This is an anonymous adventure game made using tables structured to work with the Adventure International engine (Scott Adams).  
I have converted them to work with my Gigatron version
I have described all the actions within the tables to assist with anyone interested in the game design structure.  
Once you understand the tables you can easily add random events, new commands, etc.

Enjoy
